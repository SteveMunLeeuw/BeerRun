<td>South Carolina does not allow the retail sale of alcohol for off-premise consumption on Sundays. However, counties and cities can permit beer and wine sales if the citizens vote for them in a referendum. Seven counties currently allow Sunday beer and wine sales: Richland, Georgetown, Charleston, Beaufort, Horry, Newberry and York. Cities and towns that have passed laws allowing Sunday beer and wine sales include Columbia, Lexington, Spartanburg, Greenville, Mauldin, Aiken, Rock Hill, Summerville, Santee, Daniel Island, Tega Cay and Walterboro.</td>

<td>New Jersey has no dry counties, but as of 2013, 35 municipalities (out of 565 statewide) prohibit the retail sale of alcohol. Most of the dry towns are in South Jersey, and some of them are dry because of their origins as Quaker, Methodist, or other Protestant religious communities. Dry towns in New Jersey cannot forbid the possession, consumption, or transportation of alcohol, but have the option to permit or prohibit BYOB at restaurants and social affair permits for non-profit organizations.[75][76] It is possible for a dry town to have a winery or brewery that offers tastings, since alcohol manufacturing licenses in New Jersey are issued by the state, and are not regulated by municipalities.</td>
